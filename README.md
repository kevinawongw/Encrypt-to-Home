# Encrypt-to-Home
My First Javascript game at HackCU 2019

## Description 
This project was a JavaScript game created by our group of four at HackCU. This game features a balloon who drifted away from home, and it is the players job to use encryption skills to find clues on where to navigate the balloon in order to get him home. This game is targeted towards younger children and is meant to introduce them to the basics of encryption.
